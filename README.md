# Vibe Coding Utilities

This repository now contains three independent toolsets:

1. ``filename_change`` – a collection of utilities for batch renaming files via
   a Python/Tkinter GUI or a small web UI.
2. ``segy_toolkit`` – a lightweight Python package for reading, visualising and
   processing SEG-Y (``.sgy``) seismic data.
3. ``ship_offset_visualizer`` – tools for recording ship sensor offsets and
   rendering the offsets against a 3D ship model with an OpenGL viewer.

Refer to the dedicated README files inside each folder for detailed
instructions and usage examples.
